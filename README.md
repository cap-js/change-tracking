# Change Tracking Plugin for SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/cap-js/change-tracking)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/cap-js/change-tracking)

The `@cap-js/change-tracking` package is a [CDS plugin](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-plugins#cds-plugin-packages) providing out-of-the box support for automatic capturing, storing, and viewing of the change records of modeled entities as simple as that:

1. [Install the plugin: `npm add @cap-js/change-tracking`](#setup)
2. [Add `@changelog` annotations to your CDS models](#annotations)
3. [Et voil√†:](#change-history-view)

## Preliminaries

In this guide, we use the [Incidents Management reference sample app](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) as the base to add change tracking to. Clone the repository and apply the step-by-step instructions:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app
cd incidents-app
npm i
```

**Alternatively**, you can clone the incidents app including the prepared enhancements for change-tracking:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cap-js/calesi --recursive
cd calesi
npm i
```

```sh
cds w samples/change-tracking
```



## Setup

To enable change tracking, simply add this self-configuring plugin package to your project:

```sh
npm add @cap-js/change-tracking
```



## Annotations

All we need to do is to identify what should be change-tracked by annotating respective entities and elements in our model with the `@changelog` annotation. Following the [best practice of separation of concerns](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/domain-modeling#separation-of-concerns), we do so in a separate file _srv/change-tracking.cds_:

```cds
using { ProcessorService } from './processor-service';

annotate ProcessorService.Incidents {
  customer @changelog: [customer.name];
  title    @changelog;
  status   @changelog;
}

annotate ProcessorService.Conversations with @changelog: [author, timestamp] {
  message  @changelog @Common.Label: 'Message';
}
```

The minimal annotation we require for change tracking is `@changelog` on elements, as for the elements `title` and `status` in the sample snippet above.

Additional identifiers or labels can be added to obtain more *human-readable* change records as described below.


### Human-readable Types and Fields

By default the implementation looks up *Object Type* names or *Field* namesfrom respective  `@title` or  `@Common.Label` annotations, and applies i18n lookups. If no such annotations are given, the technical names of the respective CDS definitions are displayed.

For example, without the `@title` annotation, changes to conversation entries would show up with the technical entity name:

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-type" src="_assets/changes-type-wbox.png">

With an annotation, and possible i18n translations like so:

```cds
annotate Conversations with @title: 'Conversations';
```

We get a human-readable display for *Object Type*:

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-type-hr" src="_assets/changes-type-hr-wbox.png">


### Human-readable IDs

The changelog annotations for *Object ID* are defined at entity level.

These are already human-readable by default, unless the `@changelog` definition cannot be uniquely mapped such as types `enum` or `Association`.

For example, having a `@changelog` annotation without any additional identifiers, changes to conversation entries would show up as simple entity IDs:

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Conversations {
```
<img width="1300" alt="change-history-id" src="_assets/changes-id-wbox.png">

However, this is not advisable as we cannot easily distinguish between changes. It is more appropriate to annotate as follows:

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Conversations with @changelog: [author, timestamp] {
```
<img width="1300" alt="change-history-id-hr" src="_assets/changes-id-hr-wbox.png">

Expanding the changelog annotation by additional identifiers `[author, timestamp]`, we can now better identify the `message` change events by their respective author and timestamp.


### Human-readable Values

The changelog annotations for *New Value* and *Old Value* are defined at element level.

They are already human-readable by default, unless the `@changelog` definition cannot be uniquely mapped such as types `enum` or `Association`.

For example, having a `@changelog` annotation without any additional identifiers, changes to incident customer would show up as UUIDs:

```cds
  customer @changelog;
```

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-value" src="_assets/changes-value-wbox.png">

Hence, here it is essential to add a unique identifier to obtain human-readable value columns:

```cds
  customer @changelog: [customer.name];
```

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-value-hr" src="_assets/changes-value-hr-wbox.png">


## Test-drive locally

With the steps above, we have successfully set up change tracking for our reference application. Let's see that in action.

1. **Start the server**:
  ```sh
  cds watch
  ```
2. **Make a change** on your change-tracked elements. This change will automatically be persisted in the database table (`sap.changelog.ChangeLog`) and made available in a pre-defined view, namely the [Change History view](#change-history-view) for your convenience.

## Change History View

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure proper lazy loading of the Change History table, please use **SAPUI5 version 1.120.0** or higher.<br>
> If you wish to *disable* this feature, please see the customization section on how to [disable lazy loading](#disable-lazy-loading).

<img width="1300" alt="change-history" src="_assets/changes.png">

If you have a Fiori Element application, the CDS plugin automatically provides and generates a view `sap.changelog.ChangeView`, the facet of which is automatically added to the Fiori Object Page of your change-tracked entities/elements. In the UI, this corresponds to the *Change History* table which serves to help you to view and search the stored change records of your modeled entities.

## Customizations

### Altered table view

The *Change History* view can be easily adapted and configured to your own needs by simply changing or extending it. For example, let's assume we only want to show the first 5 columns in equal spacing, we would extend `srv/change-tracking.cds` as follows:

```cds
using from '@cap-js/change-tracking';

annotate sap.changelog.ChangeView with @(
  UI.LineItem : [
    { Value: modification, @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},
    { Value: createdAt,    @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},
    { Value: createdBy,    @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},
    { Value: entity,       @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},
    { Value: objectID,     @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }}
  ]
);
```

In the UI, the *Change History* table now contains 5 equally-spaced columns with the desired properties:

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-custom" src="_assets/changes-custom.png">

For more information and examples on adding Fiori Annotations, see [Adding SAP Fiori Annotations](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/fiori#fiori-annotations).

### Disable lazy loading

To disable the lazy loading feature of the *Change History* table, you can add the following annotation to your `srv/change-tracking.cds`:

```cds
using from '@cap-js/change-tracking';

annotate sap.changelog.aspect @(UI.Facets: [{
  $Type : 'UI.ReferenceFacet',
  ID    : 'ChangeHistoryFacet',
  Label : '{i18n>ChangeHistory}',
  Target: 'changes/@UI.PresentationVariant',
  ![@UI.PartOfPreview]
}]);

```

The system now uses the SAPUI5 default setting `![@UI.PartOfPreview]: true`, such that the table will always shown when navigating to that respective Object page.
