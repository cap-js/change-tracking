## Preliminaries

In this guide, we use the [Incidents Management reference sample app](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) as the base to add change tracking to. Clone the repository and apply the step-by-step instructions:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app
cd incidents-app
npm i
```

**Alternatively**, you can clone the incidents app including the prepared enhancements for change-tracking:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cap-js/calesi --recursive
cd calesi
npm i
```

```sh
cds w samples/change-tracking
```



## Setup

To enable change tracking, simply add this self-configuring plugin package to your project:

```sh
npm add @cap-js/change-tracking
```



## Annotations

> [!WARNING]
> Please be aware that [**sensitive** or **personal** data](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/annotations#annotating-personal-data) should not be change tracked, since viewing the log allows users to circumvent [audit-logging](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/audit-logging#setup).

All we need to do is to identify what should be change-tracked by annotating respective entities and elements in our model with the `@changelog` annotation. Following the [best practice of separation of concerns](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/domain-modeling#separation-of-concerns), we do so in a separate file _srv/change-tracking.cds_:

```cds
using { ProcessorService } from './processor-service';

annotate ProcessorService.Incidents {
  customer @changelog: [customer.name];
  title    @changelog;
  status   @changelog;
}

annotate ProcessorService.Conversations with @changelog: [author, timestamp] {
  message  @changelog @Common.Label: 'Message';
}
```

The minimal annotation we require for change tracking is `@changelog` on elements, as for the elements `title` and `status` in the sample snippet above.

Additional identifiers or labels can be added to obtain more *human-readable* change records as described below.


### Human-readable Types and Fields

By default the implementation looks up *Object Type* names or *Field* namesfrom respective  `@title` or  `@Common.Label` annotations, and applies i18n lookups. If no such annotations are given, the technical names of the respective CDS definitions are displayed.

For example, without the `@title` annotation, changes to conversation entries would show up with the technical entity name:

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-type" src="_assets/changes-type-wbox.png">

With an annotation, and possible i18n translations like so:

```cds
annotate Conversations with @title: 'Conversations';
```

We get a human-readable display for *Object Type*:

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-type-hr" src="_assets/changes-type-hr-wbox.png">


### Human-readable IDs

The changelog annotations for *Object ID* are defined at entity level.

These are already human-readable by default, unless the `@changelog` definition cannot be uniquely mapped such as types `enum` or `Association`.

For example, having a `@changelog` annotation without any additional identifiers, changes to conversation entries would show up as simple entity IDs:

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Conversations {
```
<img width="1300" alt="change-history-id" src="_assets/changes-id-wbox.png">

However, this is not advisable as we cannot easily distinguish between changes. It is more appropriate to annotate as follows:

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Conversations with @changelog: [author, timestamp] {
```
<img width="1300" alt="change-history-id-hr" src="_assets/changes-id-hr-wbox.png">

Expanding the changelog annotation by additional identifiers `[author, timestamp]`, we can now better identify the `message` change events by their respective author and timestamp.


### Human-readable Values

The changelog annotations for *New Value* and *Old Value* are defined at element level.

They are already human-readable by default, unless the `@changelog` definition cannot be uniquely mapped such as types `enum` or `Association`.

For example, having a `@changelog` annotation without any additional identifiers, changes to incident customer would show up as UUIDs:

```cds
  customer @changelog;
```

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-value" src="_assets/changes-value-wbox.png">

Hence, here it is essential to add a unique identifier to obtain human-readable value columns:

```cds
  customer @changelog: [customer.name];
```

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-value-hr" src="_assets/changes-value-hr-wbox.png">


## Test-drive locally

With the steps above, we have successfully set up change tracking for our reference application. Let's see that in action.

1. **Start the server**:
  ```sh
  cds watch
  ```
2. **Make a change** on your change-tracked elements. This change will automatically be persisted in the database table (`sap.changelog.ChangeLog`) and made available in a pre-defined view, namely the [Change History view](#change-history-view) for your convenience.

## Change History View

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure proper lazy loading of the Change History table, please use **SAPUI5 version 1.120.0** or higher.<br>
> If you wish to *disable* this feature, please see the customization section on how to [disable lazy loading](#disable-lazy-loading).

<img width="1300" alt="change-history" src="_assets/changes.png">

If you have a Fiori Element application, the CDS plugin automatically provides and generates a view `sap.changelog.ChangeView`, the facet of which is automatically added to the Fiori Object Page of your change-tracked entities/elements. In the UI, this corresponds to the *Change History* table which serves to help you to view and search the stored change records of your modeled entities.

## Customizations

### Altered table view

The *Change History* view can be easily adapted and configured to your own needs by simply changing or extending it. For example, let's assume we only want to show the first 5 columns in equal spacing, we would extend `srv/change-tracking.cds` as follows:

```cds
using from '@cap-js/change-tracking';

annotate sap.changelog.ChangeView with @(
  UI.LineItem : [
    { Value: modification, @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},
    { Value: createdAt,    @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},
    { Value: createdBy,    @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},
    { Value: entity,       @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},
    { Value: objectID,     @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }}
  ]
);
```

In the UI, the *Change History* table now contains 5 equally-spaced columns with the desired properties:

<img width="1300" alt="change-history-custom" src="_assets/changes-custom.png">

For more information and examples on adding Fiori Annotations, see [Adding SAP Fiori Annotations](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/fiori#fiori-annotations).

### Disable lazy loading

To disable the lazy loading feature of the *Change History* table, you can add the following annotation to your `srv/change-tracking.cds`:

```cds
using from '@cap-js/change-tracking';

annotate sap.changelog.aspect @(UI.Facets: [{
  $Type : 'UI.ReferenceFacet',
  ID    : 'ChangeHistoryFacet',
  Label : '{i18n>ChangeHistory}',
  Target: 'changes/@UI.PresentationVariant',
  ![@UI.PartOfPreview]
}]);

```

The system now uses the SAPUI5 default setting `![@UI.PartOfPreview]: true`, such that the table will always shown when navigating to that respective Object page.

### Disable Facet

To not show the changelog facet on compositions subsites, you can use `@changelog.disable_facet` for the facet to not show up.


## Modelling Samples

This chapter describes more modelling cases for further reference, from simple to complex, including but not limited to the followings.

### Specify Object ID

Use cases for Object ID annotation

#### Use Case 1: Annotate single field/multiple fields of associated table(s) as the Object ID

Modelling in `db/schema.cds`

```cds
entity Incidents : cuid, managed {
  ...
  customer       : Association to Customers;
  title          : String @title: 'Title';
  urgency        : Association to Urgency default 'M';
  status         : Association to Status default 'N';
  ...
}

```

Add the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [customer.name, urgency.code, status.criticality] {
  title    @changelog;
}

```

![AssociationID](_assets/AssociationID.png)

#### Use Case 2: Annotate single field/multiple fields of project customized types as the Object ID

Modelling in `db/schema.cds`

```cds
entity Incidents : cuid, managed {
  ...
  customer       : Association to Customers;
  title          : String @title: 'Title';
  ...
}

entity Customers : cuid, managed {
  ...
  email          : EMailAddress;  // customized type
  phone          : PhoneNumber;   // customized type
  ...
}

```

Add the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [customer.email, customer.phone] {
  title    @changelog;
}

```

![CustomTypeID](_assets/CustomTypeID.png)

#### Use Case 3: Annotate chained associated entities from the current entity as the Object ID

Modelling in `db/schema.cds`

```cds
entity Incidents : cuid, managed {
  ...
  customer       : Association to Customers;
  ...
}

entity Customers : cuid, managed {
  ...
  addresses : Association to Addresses;
  ...
}

```

Add the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [customer.addresses.city, customer.addresses.postCode] {
  title    @changelog;
}

```

![ChainedAssociationID](_assets/ChainedAssociationID.png)

> Change-tracking supports annotating chained associated entities from the current entity as object ID of current entity in case the entity in consumer applications is a pure relation table. However, the usage of chained associated entities is not recommended due to performance cost.

### Tracing Changes

Use cases for tracing changes

#### Use Case 1: Trace the changes of child nodes from the current entity and display the meaningful data from child nodes (composition relation)

Modelling in `db/schema.cds`

```cds
entity Incidents : managed, cuid {
  ...
  title          : String @title: 'Title';
  conversation   : Composition of many Conversation;
  ...
}

aspect Conversation: managed, cuid {
    ...
    message   : String;
}

```

Add the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [title] {
  conversation @changelog: [conversation.message];
}

```

![CompositionChange](_assets/CompositionChange.png)

#### Use Case 2: Trace the changes of associated entities from the current entity and display the meaningful data from associated entities (association relation)

Modelling in `db/schema.cds`

```cds
entity Incidents : cuid, managed {
  ...
  customer       : Association to Customers;
  title          : String @title: 'Title';
  ...
}

entity Customers : cuid, managed {
  ...
  email          : EMailAddress;
  ...
}

```

Add the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [title] {
  customer @changelog: [customer.email];
}

```

![AssociationChange](_assets/AssociationChange.png)

#### Use Case 3: Trace the changes of fields defined by project customized types and display the meaningful data

Modelling in `db/schema.cds`

```cds
type StatusType : Association to Status;

entity Incidents : cuid, managed {
  ...
  title          : String @title: 'Title';
  status         : StatusType default 'N';
  ...
}

```

Add the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [title] {
  status   @changelog: [status.code];
}

```

![CustomTypeChange](_assets/CustomTypeChange.png)

#### Use Case 4: Trace the changes of chained associated entities from the current entity and display the meaningful data from associated entities (association relation)

Modelling in `db/schema.cds`

```cds
entity Incidents : cuid, managed {
  ...
  title          : String @title: 'Title';
  customer       : Association to Customers;
  ...
}

entity Customers : cuid, managed {
  ...
  addresses : Association to Addresses;
  ...
}

```

Add the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [title] {
  customer @changelog: [customer.addresses.city, customer.addresses.streetAddress];
}

```

![ChainedAssociationChange](_assets/ChainedAssociationChange.png)

> Change-tracking supports analyzing chained associated entities from the current entity in case the entity in consumer applications is a pure relation table. However, the usage of chained associated entities is not recommended due to performance cost.

#### Use Case 5: Trace the changes of union entity and display the meaningful data

`Payable.cds`:

```cds
entity Payables : cuid {
    displayId    : String;
    @changelog
    name         : String;
    cryptoAmount : Decimal;
    fiatAmount   : Decimal;
};

```

`Payment.cds`:

```cds
entity Payments : cuid {
    displayId : String; //readable ID
    @changelog
    name      : String;
};

```

Union entity in `BusinessTransaction.cds`:

```cds
entity BusinessTransactions          as(
    select from payments.Payments{
        key ID,
            displayId,
            name,
            changes  : Association to many ChangeView
                on changes.objectID = ID AND changes.entity = 'payments.Payments'
    }
)
union all
(
    select from payables.Payables {
        key ID,
            displayId,
            name,
            changes  : Association to many ChangeView
               on changes.objectID = ID AND changes.entity = 'payables.Payables'
    }
);

```

![UnionChange.png](_assets/UnionChange.png)

### Don'ts

Don'ts

#### Use Case 1: Don't trace changes for field(s) with `Association to many`

```cds
entity Customers : cuid, managed {
  ...
  incidents : Association to many Incidents on incidents.customer = $self;
}

```

The reason is that: the relationship: `Association to many` is only for modelling purpose and there is no concrete field in database table. In the above sample, there is no column for incidents in the table Customers, but there is a navigation property of incidents in Customers OData entity metadata.

#### Use Case 2: Don't trace changes for field(s) with *Unmanaged Association*

```cds
entity AggregatedBusinessTransactionData @(cds.autoexpose) : cuid {
    FootprintInventory: Association to one FootprintInventories
                        on  FootprintInventory.month                      = month
                        and FootprintInventory.year                       = year
                        and FootprintInventory.FootprintInventoryScope.ID = FootprintInventoryScope.ID;
    ...
}

```

The reason is that: When deploying to relational databases, Associations are mapped to foreign keys. Yet, when mapped to non-relational databases they're just references. More details could be found in [Prefer Managed Associations](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/domain-models#managed-associations). In the above sample, there is no column for FootprintInventory in the table AggregatedBusinessTransactionData, but there is a navigation property FootprintInventoryof in OData entity metadata.

#### Use Case 3: Don't trace changes for CUD on DB entity

```cds
this.on("UpdateActivationStatus", async (req) =>
    // PaymentAgreementsOutgoingDb is the DB entity
    await UPDATE.entity(PaymentAgreementsOutgoingDb)
        .where({ ID: paymentAgreement.ID })
        .set({ ActivationStatus_code: ActivationCodes.ACTIVE });
);

```

The reason is that: Application level services are by design the only place where business logic is enforced. This by extension means, that it also is the only point where e.g. change-tracking would be enabled. The underlying method used to do change tracking is `req.diff` which is responsible to read the necessary before-image from the database, and this method is not available on DB level.
