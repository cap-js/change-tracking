## Version 2.0.0-beta.6 - 26.03.26

### Added
- Provide detailed plan for v1 to v2 HANA migration
- Generation of `.hdbmigrationtable` and updating `undeploy.json` via `cds add change-tracking-migration`

### Fixed

## Version 2.0.0-beta.5 - 17.03.26

### Added
- Support dynamic localized label lookup, meaning if for example a property is change tracked and its change tracking label (@changelog : [<association>.<localized_prop>]) points to one localized property from its code list entity, the label is dynamically fetched when the change is read based on the users locale.

### Fixed
- Postgres considers `disable*Tracking` for children changes
